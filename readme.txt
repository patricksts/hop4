To test the cloud functions:

1. Log in to GCP

2 navigate to the image bucket: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/vision-image-bucket1

3. Upload an image of your choice that includes some form of text (preferably in a language that is not your own). There is a test image included in the images file of this project, should you like.

4. navigate to the translations bucket: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/vision-translation-bucket
You can view the newly created text file that will contain the translation from your image

This project was completed with assistance from source code and tutorials produced by Google Cloud documentation.


Yay!
